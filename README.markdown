Hinted Text Input field
-----------------------

In some places in the Symphony backend, a text-input field can be filled by clicking one of the values below.

An example is the section editor. All previously used navigation groups are listed below the input field.
All that is needed to use one of these values is to simply click the value.

This field replicates that behaviour for a standard input field. The suggestions below the field are based on values currently used.
These values are sorted by popularity.
